 This is a game made in java using:
 * <a href="lwjgl.org">LWJGL</a> for OpenGL, OpenCL, OpenAL and GLFW bindings
 * <a href="https://joml-ci.github.io/JOML/">JOML</a> for math involving vectors, matrices and... other stuff 

I still have no idea what the game is about or how it should play out, but that's part of the fun (I guess).
